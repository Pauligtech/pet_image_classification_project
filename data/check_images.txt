Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

No, the three architectures did not classify Dog_01.jpg as the same breed. 

AlexNet misclassified it as appenzeller, while ResNet and VGG correctly classified it as bernese mountain dog. As shown from the output below;

AlexNet: appenzeller (incorrect)

ResNet: bernese mountain dog (correct)

VGG: bernese mountain dog (correct)


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

No, not all models did. AlexNet did not classify Dog_01.jpg the same as Dog_02.jpg. ResNet and VGG classified both images as bernese mountain dog, so they were consistent.

The differences in their classification is shown below;

AlexNet: Dog_01.jpg = appenzeller, Dog_02.jpg = bernese mountain dog → mismatch

ResNet: Dog_01.jpg = bernese mountain dog, Dog_02.jpg = bernese mountain dog → match

VGG: Dog_01.jpg = bernese mountain dog, Dog_02.jpg = bernese mountain dog → match


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 

Yes, all three models correctly classified the non-dog images (Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg), and No misclassifications occurred.

Coffee_mug_01.jpg: classified as coffee mug

Black_bear_01.jpg: classified as black bear



4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:

Based on the results for the four uploaded images, ResNet performed the best. It correctly classified all images, including both dog breeds and non-dog images, achieving 100% accuracy for dogs, non-dogs, and dog breeds. 

While VGG also achieved 100% accuracy, ResNet had a slightly lower runtime, making it marginally more efficient. AlexNet performed well on dog/non-dog classification but had lower breed classification accuracy (50%). 

Therefore, considering both classification accuracy and efficiency, ResNet is the best-performing model for this task.
